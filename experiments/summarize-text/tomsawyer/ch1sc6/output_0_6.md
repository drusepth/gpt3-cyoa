**Summary:**
**The Scuffle -- A Private Entrance -**
Tom and the new boy, named William Robbins, meet for the first time. Tom takes out his money and offers it to the boy, saying he will give him the coins if he can do a good job of fighting. Robbins, who is a bigger boy than Tom, is insulted and rejects the offer. The two boys begin fighting. They roll around on the ground, punching each other and wrestling. The boys’ friends gather to watch. Tom ends up on top of Robbins, and begins to beat him. Robbins is crying, but he does not give up. Tom beats Robbins until he finally cries “enough.”

The boys go home. Robbins is crying and Tom is covered in dust. Robbins is mad at Tom and vows to get him back.

Tom gets home late, and is in trouble. His aunt is waiting for him. She is furious and says that Tom’s clothes are dirty. She says that he will not be allowed to go out on Saturday, but will have to stay in and work.

Analysis:

"The Scuffle" is the first of the Tom Sawyer stories. It introduces the main characters of the novel, including Tom, Aunt Polly, and Huckleberry Finn. The story begins with a description of Tom, who is about ten years old. Twain describes Tom as a boy who is both mischievous and kind. He is also described as a “sickly, lonesome and romantic” boy. Tom is mischievous because he has a tendency to get into trouble. He is kind because he helps out his friends. He is also a lonesome boy because he has no friends to play with. The story also introduces Tom’s aunt, who is a strong woman. She is angry with Tom because he has been out late and his clothes are dirty.

The description of Tom also gives the reader a hint of Tom’s character. He is described as having a “hearty and ruddy countenance.” He is also described as “slim and straight” and as having “bright and eager eyes.” He is a “brisk, go-a-head boy.” Tom is described as being energetic, and he has a lot of energy and drive. He is described as being mischievous, and as having a quick temper.
