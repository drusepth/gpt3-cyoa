**Summary:**
**The Scuffle -- A Private Entrance -**

The new boy takes two coppers out of his pocket and holds them out with derision. Tom strikes them to the ground. In an instant both boys are rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists. “Holler 'nuff!” said he.

The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.

“Holler 'nuff!”--and the pounding went on.

At last the stranger got out a smothered “'Nuff!” and Tom let him up and said:

“Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next time.”

The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.” To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope.

**Summary:**
**The Scuffle -- A Private Entrance -**

A new boy, Sid, arrives in town and goes to school. He is very proud and
disdainful of the local boys. He has a large sum of money with him, and
shows it off. He is immediately picked on by Tom Sawyer, who wants to
steal the money. Tom calls Sid a “stuck-up thing” and taunts him about
his money. Sid offers Tom two coppers to fight him. Tom throws the
coppers on the ground and attacks Sid. The two boys roll around in the
dirt, punching and scratching each other. They are evenly matched, and
the fight ends in a draw.

The New Boy -- The Schoolhouse -

The boys go to school, and Tom is immediately picked on by the teacher.
The teacher tells Tom to stand up and read a passage from the Bible.
Tom refuses, and the teacher threatens to whip him. Tom stands up and
reads the passage, but he reads it in a mocking tone. The teacher
reprimands him and sends him to the corner. Tom is angry, and he
threatens to get back at the teacher.

The New Boy -- The Fight -

The boys go outside to play. Tom is still angry, and he is determined to
get back at the teacher. He sees Sid and calls him over. Tom challenges
Tom to a fight. Sid accepts, and the two boys begin to fight. The fight
ends in a draw.

The New Boy -- The Ambush -

Tom gets home late, and he is caught by his aunt. She is furious and
threatens to punish him. Tom sneaks into the house and goes to bed. He
is awakened by his aunt, who tells him that he is going to be punished.
Tom is terrified, and he begs his aunt to let him go. She tells him that
he is going to be punished, and she drags him out of bed.

The New Boy -- The Punishment -

Analysis:

This chapter is a good example of the way that Twain uses language to
create a particular tone and mood. The language is very straightforward,
and the events are described in a matter-of-fact way. The language is
very simple, and the sentences are short. This is a good example of
the way that Twain uses language to create a particular tone and mood.

**Summary:**
**The Scuffle -- A Private Entrance -**

The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and
clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves
with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
with his fists. “Holler 'nuff!” said he.

The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.

“Holler 'nuff!”--and the pounding went on.

At last the stranger got out a smothered “'Nuff!” and Tom let him up and
said:

“Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next
time.”

The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.” To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it

He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in

Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
firmness.
