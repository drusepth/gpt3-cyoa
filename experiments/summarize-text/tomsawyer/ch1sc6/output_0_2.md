The Scuffle

The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and
clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves
with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
with his fists. “Holler 'nuff!” said he.

The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.

“Holler 'nuff!”--and the pounding went on.

At last the stranger got out a smothered “'Nuff!” and Tom let him up and
said:

“Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next
time.”

The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.” To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the

for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and

The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.

At last the stranger got out a smothered “'Nuff!” and Tom let him up and

**The Scuffle -- A Private Entrance -**

The new boy takes two coppers out of his pocket and holds them out with derision. Tom strikes them to the ground. In an instant both boys are rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats. They tug and tear at each other's hair and clothes, punch and scratch each other's nose, and cover themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion takes form, and through the fog of battle Tom appears, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists. “Holler 'nuff!” says he.

The boy only struggles to free himself. He is crying--mainly from rage.

“Holler 'nuff!”--and the pounding goes on.

At last the stranger gets out a smothered “'Nuff!” and Tom lets him up and says:

“Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next time.”

The new boy goes off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he will do to Tom the “next time he catches him out.” To which Tom responds with jeers, and starts off in high feather, and as soon as his back is turned the new boy snatches up a stone, throws it and hits him between the shoulders, and then turns tail and runs like an antelope. Tom chases the traitor home, and thus finds out where he lives. He then holds a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only makes faces at him through the window and declines. At last the enemy's mother appears, and calls Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and orders him away. So he goes away; but he says he “'lowed” to “lay” for that boy.

He gets home pretty late that night, and when he climbs cautiously in at the window, he uncovers an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she sees the state his clothes are in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor becomes adamantine in its firmness.

**Summary:**
**The Scuffle -- A Private Entrance -**

The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and
clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves
with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
with his fists. “Holler 'nuff!” said he.

The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.

“Holler 'nuff!”--and the pounding went on.

At last the stranger got out a smothered “'Nuff!” and Tom let him up and
said:

“Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next
time.”

The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.” To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the

He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in

when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
firmness.
