"Good-evening," says the stranger.

"Good-evening," says Tom.

"My name's Huckleberry Finn--what's yours?"

"Tom Sawyer."

"Are you going to stay here long, Tom?"

"I reckon. You?"

"I'm going to live here. I'm in line for the presidency when they get

through with the constitution."

"Are you sure?"

"Quite sure, because I'm going to help make the constitution."

"It's a good country, I reckon."

"All countries are good that are ours. I'm a native."

"I'm glad of that."

"We don't want any immigrants here. We're full up as it is."

"Have you got a sweetheart?"

"No."

"Well, you better get one. In this country a boy ain't any good unless

he's got a sweetheart. They keep him from getting into trouble."

"Who's your sweetheart, Huck Finn?"

"Girls are a nuisance. I don't want any of them round, Jim don't,

neither. But if I had a sweetheart I'd go straight. I wouldn't do

anything to hurt her, and I'd keep her out of all harm. We'd be

happy, and have some right smart of picnics and parties, and go

swimming and boating, and just have the best kind of a time."

"Well, that sounds like it. I wish I had a sweetheart."

"So do I. And I wish I had

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**
Tom Sawyer practices his new whistling technique. He is so absorbed in this new interest that he does not notice a stranger boy approaching. When the two boys meet, neither speaks. They simply move around each other, staring at each other. Tom is so distracted by the stranger's appearance that he forgets his own troubles.

Analysis:

This passage is a good example of the way in which Twain uses the techniques of realism. The passage is written in the style of a newspaper article, and the events are presented as if they were real, not fictional. The passage is also written in the style of a first-person narrative, which makes the reader feel as if he or she is actually experiencing the events.

The passage also uses the technique of foreshadowing, which is a literary device that hints at events that will occur later in the story. The passage begins with Tom Sawyer practicing his new whistling technique. He is so absorbed in this new interest that he does not notice a stranger boy approaching. This foreshadows the fact that the stranger will be an important character later in the story.

The passage also uses the technique of characterization, which is a literary device that reveals the personality traits of a character. The narrator describes Tom as being so absorbed in his new interest that he forgets his troubles. This shows that Tom is a person who is easily distracted by new things.

The passage also uses the technique of symbolism, which is a literary device that represents something by using an object that is associated with that thing. The passage describes Tom as being so distracted by the stranger's appearance that he forgets his own troubles. This symbolizes the fact that Tom is so distracted by the stranger's appearance that he does not notice the fact that the stranger is stealing his pocket knife.

The passage also uses the technique of foreshadowing, which is a literary device that hints at events that will occur later in the story. The passage begins with Tom Sawyer practicing his new whistling technique. He is so absorbed in this new interest that he does not notice a stranger boy approaching.
