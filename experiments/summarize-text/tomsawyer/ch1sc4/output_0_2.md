**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

Tom is practicing his new whistle when he spies a newcomer. The boy is well dressed and has a citified air about him. Tom is envious of the boy's finery and shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seems to him to grow. Neither boy speaks. If one moves, the other moves--but only sidewise, in a circle; they keep face to face and eye to eye all the time.

The stranger moved first. He said:

"My name's Bob. What's yours?"

His voice was agreeable--not particularly sweet or strong, but

pleasantly harmonious and soft. Tom answered:

"Tom."

"Did you hear me whistle?"

"Yes."

"I reckon you wish you could do it, don't you?"

Tom was silent.

"Could you learn?"

Tom turned upon his questioner suddenly, and exclaimed:

"I'll bet I could if I tried!"

"Well, you can try, maybe, if you've a mind to. I'm going to learn

you."

"All right--begin now."

"It's too dark. Wait till we get to the lamp."

"No, now. I can do it in the dark. I've done it before."

"Oh, that's nothing. I've done it in the dark hundreds of times--any

body could if they'd a mind to."

"Well, I will, then."

"All right, I'll learn you. Haven't you got a pipe?"

"No."

"Well, that's a good thing, anyway. If you had you'd get to

smokin' and come to be a pipe-smoker and then you'd be sorry.

You've got to have a pipe to learn on, and then you'll be so sick

you'll never want to see a pipe again. I've learned lots of boys, and

they all got to liking the pipe, and so did I, and I never got over it

till I was grown and could do what I pleased. You want to make a

promise, now, that you won't ever smoke a pipe."

"All right, I promise."

"Say, now, if you've got to make a

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

Tom is practicing his music when a new boy, a stranger, appears. Tom is

shocked by the boy's appearance and is even more shocked when he realizes

that the boy is better dressed than he is. Tom is so shocked by the boy's

appearance that he forgets his troubles.

Text:

Tom was not a very good boy. He had a hard, covetous heart, and

therefore he had no friends. He had "never done a kind thing in his life."

He was full of envy, selfishness, and malice.

Tom was a great hand to skulk and hide, when he saw a boy coming

that he wanted to avoid. He always went about with a suppressed

whimper, for he was always getting whipped--for stealing, or

misbehaving in school, or for being found in other boys' play-grounds,

or for making mischief. He had a good reason to whimper, for he was

always getting whipped.

Summary:

Tom's Character -

Tom is a very bad boy. He is envious, selfish, and malicious. He is

always getting into trouble and is always getting whipped for it.

Text:

Tom had a hard time of it, from morning till night. He had to

grind his corn, and chop his wood, and wash his dishes, and slop his

hogs, and feed his poultry, and plow his ground, and labor on his father's

farm, and run errands for his mother, and work on Saturdays cleaning

out the stable, and on Sundays go to church, and pray, and hear a

sermon, and repeat the sermon next day.

Tom had a hard time of it, but he had one comfort--he could

whistle. He could whistle a common tune, such as "The Girl I Left

behind me," or "The Girl I Left behind me, she's the sweetest

girl I know," or "She was a Daisy," or "The Blue Juniata," or "The

Wild Rover," or "The Wearing of the Green," or "The High-Low-Jack,"

or "The Wagoner," or "She was a Dandy," or "The Roving Journeyman

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

Tom is practicing his music when he spies a new boy in town. The boy is well dressed and has a new whistle. Tom is envious of the boy's whistle and his new clothes. Tom is so envious that he begins to whistle the same tune as the boy. The boys walk around each other in a circle, keeping their eyes on each other.

Text:

Tom was not in a good humor--a little more so than usual, perhaps.

The fact is, he felt poor. He had only ten cents in the world--and some
of that he thought he had earned and some of it he hadn't. He had
worked three days that week, and earned six cents, and paid his
wholesome board with it, and had a cent and a half left. And he hadn't
earned that half a cent; it was given to him. He had saved up three
coppers the week before and buried them in a corner of his
garret and had not been able to find them when he wanted to
show them and enjoy their riches.

He had bought a whistle, and paid for it with one of the three coppers
and had blown it all day Sunday and thought himself rich in the
delight of it, and then on Monday his step-mother had found it and
taken it away from him and said it was not worth the whistle to
make a boy whistle his soul out on it.

He had had to do chores all day Saturday, and the half-cent was the

reward of his industry. He had felt rich with the prospect of buying
some white marbles with it, but that hope was blasted.

He had wanted a white marble badly, but that was not his worst want.

He had gone two days without candy, and that was the worst of all.

He had two pieces of candy in his pocket, but his mother had forbidden
him to eat them. They were his Sunday-school treat. He had a
dime and two coppers left, and he wanted to buy some more candy
with it. He had six white marbles and a pretty fair collection of
colored ones, but it was not enough. He wanted a whole pocketful of
them. He wanted a bagful. He wanted to be a millionaire and own
a candy store. He wanted to be a rich man and have a great many
things.

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

Tom is in a bad mood because he has been forced to work on a Friday. He

spies a new boy in town, who is well dressed. Tom is so impressed with

the new boy's appearance that he forgets his troubles and practices his

new whistling technique.

Text:

Tom was not a very good boy. He was naturally of a roving, adventurous

disposition, and the village life and the village boys did not agree with

him. He was often in trouble. Not serious trouble, the sort of trouble

that reaches the ears of the law, but trouble enough to make his name

not a pleasant one to have.

He had been in the habit of tagging after his big brother Henry, and

his big brother Henry had a bad name in the village, and deserved it.

He was a dissipated, good-for-nothing fellow, good for nothing but

mischief. He was a bad influence on everybody about him, and with

Tom he was especially so. He taught him all his bad habits, led him into

all sorts of mischief, and set him against his father and mother, and

against the respect of the community. He even got him to disobeying his

parents, and to saying words of defiance and taking on airs of

independence.

Tom's father was a hard-working, honest man, but very strict and

severe in his ideas of duty and his notions of respect for one's

superiors. He was a deacon in the church. He was a very just man, and

very strict in his notions of right and wrong, and very particular about

the truth. He was a good man, but very different in his ideas of things

from Tom's brother Henry. Henry was a scoffer, and had no respect for

anything or anybody. He was a bad, bad boy, and Tom was fast

following in his steps.

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

The narrator describes Tom's new hobby of whistling. He has learned the skill from a black man and is eager to practice it. He is so engrossed in his new hobby that he does not notice a new boy in town. The new boy is well dressed and has a "citified air" about him. Tom is so impressed by the new boy's appearance that he feels shabby in comparison. Neither boy speaks. They continue to walk in circles around each other, staring at each other.

The new boy moved on, and Tom turned and followed at his heels,
keeping abreast of him and on the alert to find an opportunity to speak.

He was not disappointed. The boy stopped to look in at the shop window
of a saddler. Tom stopped too. Presently the boy moved on, and Tom
followed him to the window of a cobbler--a shoe-shop--a store for
women's ready-made clothing--a grocery--a notion-shop--still Tom
followed at his heels, matching him step for step, with his eye on his
face and his tongue hanging out with longing to speak.

Text:

At last the new boy stopped in front of the window of a bakery.

There was a crowd there, and the window was full of nice things--

plump, split-open, sugar-coated cakes; golden loaves; frosted
buns; tarts with patterned crusts--well, a body could see that a
man who could afford to shop there needn't be ashamed of his
tongue's aching to begin a conversation with the boy.
