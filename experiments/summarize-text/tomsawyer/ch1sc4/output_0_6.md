The following text is a summary of the passage above.

The two boys walk in circles. They are facing one another and staring at one another. Neither boy speaks.

Analysis:

This summary includes all of the important ideas from the above text.

Text:

Tom felt as a king might feel who has been deposed and robbed of his

throne, and is left to feed on the scraps of the royal table. He was

conscious of a most burning desire to speak, and break the freezing

silence, but it was unutterable. He thought of speaking, but his heart

quailed--there was that in the other's eye which showed him that the

spoken word would not be well received. So he battled with his

longing, and kept the fire in his bosom from bursting into utterance by

an exercise of the sturdiest self-denial.

He would have given anything to be able to whistle, for he had a

whistling talent, and there was the finest opportunity to display it
that could be imagined, but he had no heart to try it.

Text:

At last the new boy spoke--without moving, but just turning his
head and looking at Tom out of the corners of his eyes--a cunning
move, but not quite cunning enough to deceive Tom.

"What's yer name?"

"Tom."

"Where 'bouts do you live?"

"In that house right straight ahead there, that one with the white
steps and the big tree and the swing."

"That's my house!"

"Is it?"

"Yer ma's a nice lady."

"Yes, she is. Is your ma nice?"

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

Tom is enraptured by his new whistle, which he practices in a manner that
indicates he is not aware of the "sounds" that he is producing. He is
interrupted by a well-dressed boy, who is also practicing music. The two
boys do not speak but rather continue to practice their music in a
circular motion, "eye to eye and face to face."

Text:
Tom was not a very nice boy, by any means; he was not a
brutal or a selfish boy, but one could easily see that he was low-bred.
His language was coarse, and he expressed himself with an
unnecessary abundance of oaths. His companions were of the same
sort--not particularly bad, but just low-bred, ignorant, and
vulgar. There was about all of them an air of bravado and swagger
that was as absurd as it was offensive to a person of true gentility.

The new-comer took in Tom's whole outfit with a careless glance--
clothing,
whistle, attitude, and visage. Then he turned to inspect Tom's
companions. He seemed to be quite satisfied with his survey. Then he
lifted his hat courteously to an elderly lady who was passing, and
laughed out quite loud when she jumped and seemed frightened.

Summary:
The Newcomer and His Reaction to Tom -

The new boy is well dressed and courteous to adults and is mature in nature.
This new boy is very different from Tom, who is "low-bred" and vulgar.
Tom and his friends are also immature and make loud noises.

Text:
"I'll learn you," said the new-comer, with an air of quiet
confidence.

"I'd like to see you doing it," said Tom.

"All right," said the other, "I'll begin right away."

"All right," said Tom.

"Say--"

"Well?"

"Do you know who I am?"

"No, not I."

"Well, I'm the new drummer."

"Indeed!"

"Yes. And if you know what's good for you, you'll treat me with
some respect."

"Respect?--why, you ain't anybody

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

Text:
Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not
because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new
interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired
from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It
must be borne in mind that in those unquiet days it was not easy to
practise any accomplishment in peace and comfort. The union of the
States had not been accomplished, and feeling was tense throughout the
land. Mobs were everywhere, lawless and violent, and village
authorities were either helpless or partisan or both. In many places,
for a long time after this, if a boy got himself the reputation of being
a "quick" or "smart" lad, he was likely to have some worse reputation
attached to him. The village where Tom lived, for instance, had a
reputation for unusual lawlessness and violence. It was a custom for
the stronger boys to take advantage of these conditions to capture and
hold the weak ones, and make them do all sorts of drudgery and
mischief. The weak ones had to submit; there was no other way. If they
resisted, the strong ones were liable to whip them or beat them with
sticks or cowhide them--or they might be killed. Any boy who was
caught fighting in the streets with his fists was always arrested, and
sometimes whipped--though he might be the one who was attacked.

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

Tom and a stranger stare at each other. Neither boy speaks. Tom practices his new whistling skill, while the stranger watches. The stranger seems out of place in a poor village like St. Petersburg. He is well-dressed and well-spoken. Tom begins to feel poor and shabby.

Text:

The stranger moved first. He turned on his heel and walked away.

Tom's curiosity was aroused--the more so because the stranger walked
with the free, unconstrained step of a person who is going somewhere
and not merely taking a walk. Tom followed, keeping at a safe distance.

The stranger went straight through the village and out the other side. He
stopped at a neat white frame house of moderate size. Evidently his
home. Tom was disappointed and wondered why the boy had come to St.

Petersburg at all. He had come for a purpose, though; Tom was convinced of
that. He had come to St. Petersburg to put on style--to show off. Tom
endured another trial presently. The stranger took out a key, opened the
front gate, passed up the garden path and knocked at the door. A

maiden lady of forty answered the knock--mother, of course. And yet
the stranger had said, "Sis," when he spoke to her.

He put his arm around her neck and kissed her, then turned and introduced
himself to Tom with easy grace--and he was the awkwardest boy in the
country.

Tom was dumbfounded. He stared from the stranger to his sister and
back again. The brother turned to the sister and said:

"I met Tom Sawyer on the road, and he says there's a haunted house
up the St. Petersburg road, and he's been waiting to go and explore it
ever since. Ain't that so, Tom?"

"Yes," said Tom.

"He says it's haunted by a ghost that waves a spectral hand and
says, "Don't go!" and that's all she does. Tom was afraid at first,
but now he's going with us."

"Us?"

"Yes, sir--Mother, Father, Betty, Susy, and me. You see, Mother,
he says if I don't go he'll tell all the fellows on the playground
that I'm a girl."

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

A new boy in town, a well dressed boy with a citified air, was a novel
sight. The boys were equally impressed with each other, but Tom's
impression was the stronger. Tom's clothes were shabby, but the new boy's
were new. Tom's shoes were worn out, but the new boy's were new. Tom

spied the new boy and his heart began to beat faster. Tom's first
impulse was to run away, but he was ashamed of his reaction. Tom's
newfound interest in music distracted him from his fear. Tom was
practicing his new skill when the new boy approached. The boys were
both silent. They began to circle each other, and their eyes never
left each other. Tom's heart was beating fast again.

Text:
"You got a knife?"

Tom was stupefied--thunderstruck. He gazed at the stranger with
involuntary awe. It was not any particular thing that the stranger said
--it
was the way he said it. No girl could have said it just that way. It was
the tone that Tom recognized, first of all--that smooth, sweet,
flutelike tone, with the undercurrent of sarcasm and menace. Then Tom

saw that the stranger was smiling--and he began to understand.

"Got a knife?"

The stranger repeated.

"Yes," said Tom. His voice sounded like a stranger's voice, too.

"Will you lend it to me?"

"Yes."

Tom put his hand in his pocket. His fingers were trembling. He got
the knife out, opened it, and handed it, open, to the stranger. The
stranger took it. There was another long silence. Tom was trying to
comprehend.

"What do you want it for?" said Tom.

The stranger leaned forward a little and smiled down at Tom. There
was that in the smile that made Tom's lips go dry.

"Never mind," said the stranger. "I'll return it."

He put the knife in his own pocket.

"What's your name?"

"Tom."

"Tom what?"

"Nothing."

The stranger's eyes began to sparkle with a light that made Tom
shudder.

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**

This is a short story about Tom Sawyer, a young boy in a small town. Tom is a boy who loves to play tricks and explore the town. One day he is in a hurry to go home and play music with his fiddle, so he does not see a newcomer. This boy is dressed in fancy clothes and has a neat appearance. He is not a boy from the town, but from a bigger city. Tom is very jealous of this boy and feels as if he is superior to him. Tom decides to practice his music, but he can not because the newcomer is practicing his own music. Tom is very jealous of this boy and wishes he was like him.

Text:

But the new boy was not aware of his notice--did not even suspect it.

He could not play a note. He could not even own a fiddle. He could

not sing a song. He was perfect and complete in his own eyes, and

content. He was a master of situation, and could have been a

master of anything else, if he had cared to try. He had never heard
forbidden music before. He could not tell whether he liked it or
not.

Summary:
Tom's Jealousy of the New Boy -

Tom is very jealous of the new boy because he is dressed so nice and can play music. Tom wishes he could be like the new boy. He feels as if he is superior to the new boy. Tom decides to spy on the new boy and find out if he is as great as he seems. Tom sees the new boy spying on him and is surprised to see that the new boy is spying on him too. Tom is now feeling very bad about himself and wishes he could be like the new boy.

Text:

He was so busy trying to remember the way to do it that he did not

notice that the new boy had moved. When he looked up and saw that

the other was gone, he was astonished. He got up and hunted around

somewhat, but with little hope. It would be like the new boy to

hide and surprise him. So he gave up the hunt and went on down the

street, feeling dull and dreary. He had lost his whistle, too, and so

had no music. He moped into the alley and put his head down on his

knees

The stranger walks away.

Text:

Tom was not a bad boy, by any means, but he was busy with other
thoughts just then. He picked up his whistle and put it to his lips.

But he couldn't make a sound with it. He tried again--same result.

He tried a third time with the same result. There was something the
matter with that whistle! Tom stared at it a moment, with a puzzled
expression, and then said "Wait!" and began to hunt through his
clothes for the note his mother had given him. He found it presently,
and held it close to his whistle. No, that wasn't it. He tried the
next one. It proved to be the right one. Now he blew—and bliss was
in that sound! The sweet, mellow notes floated away on the still
air, and seemed to vanish in the far-off distance. Tom listened,

with head tilted back and the breeze stirring his hair, and murmured

"Oh, but ain't it lovely!" Then he tried it over again—just for the
sake of enjoying that music once more. And while he was thus
busied, his heart went out in gratitude to the friend who had taught
him the lovely trick.

**Summary:**
**Tom Practices Music and Spies a Newcomer -**
Tom is whistling a tune that he has learned from a black boy. He walks down the street, unaware that he is being watched. He stops whistling when he notices a stranger approaching him. Tom stops because he is concerned that the stranger will think he is a "nigger." The stranger is a white boy, and is dressed much better than Tom. Tom compares himself to the stranger and realizes that he is much shabbier than the newcomer. The two boys stare at each other for a moment before the stranger turns away.

Analysis:

This is the first chapter of the novel, and it sets the stage for the rest of the book. The novel is written in the third person and is told from an omniscient point of view. The narrator knows what is going on in all of the characters' minds, but is not a character in the story. This chapter begins with a description of Tom. Tom is a young boy who is poor, and is from a small town. He is also described as being a good-hearted boy who is polite and kind. He is whistling a tune that he has learned from a black boy, which is seen as unusual because the black people in the town are not respected. The whistling of the tune is described as being "warbled," and it is a "new and powerful interest" that takes Tom's mind off of his troubles. This "new and powerful interest" is a bird-like whistle that he is trying to learn. He is very determined to learn this whistle, and he is "suffering to practice it un-disturbed." He wants to learn this whistle so that he can impress the stranger that he sees in front of him. The stranger is described as being a boy a little larger than Tom. He is also well dressed, and he is wearing a necktie. Tom is very envious of the stranger's outfit. He is so envious that he does not even realize that he is staring at the stranger. This is a good example of the way that Tom is not very self-aware. He is so focused on his envy that he does not realize that he is being rude. He is not able to see that the stranger might have been watching him. Tom is described as being very self-conscious about his clothes. He does not like to wear his old clothes, but he does not have the money to buy new clothes. He is also very self-conscious about his shabby appearance. He is very aware of how
