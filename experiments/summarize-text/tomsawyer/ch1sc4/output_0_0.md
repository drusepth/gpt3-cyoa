**Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not**
**because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a**
**man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore**
**them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's**
**misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new**
**interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired**
**from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It**
**consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,**
**produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short**
**intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to**
**do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him**
**the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of**
**harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer**
**feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as strong, deep,**
**unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the**
**astronomer.**

**The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom**
**checked his whistle. A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger**
**than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive**
**curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy**
**was well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day. This was simply as**
**astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth**
**roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes**
**on--and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of**
**ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The**
**more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose**
**at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to**
**him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved--but only**
**sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the**
**time.**

Tom was not a bad boy. In fact, he was a rather good boy. He had

been brought up by his grandmother, and had a fair education in a poor

school in the village, and had been kept down at the bottom of the school

by the teacher because he was poor and the teacher was mean. He had

never been able to learn much or read much, but he had a good deal of

that kind of knowledge that makes a person useful. He could use his hands

well, and he could do a number of things that farmers or anybody else

would pay for. He had a little money, too, for he was a sharp trader

when he got a chance to be one. He had made nearly a dollar once in a

trade with a boatman, and he was quite proud of it and of the trade too.

He had taken a lot of fish, and had traded them for a big catfish that he

thought was a pickerel, and the man had traded him for it a big pickerel

that he thought was a catfish, and neither of them had found out the

trick till they had swapped fish a good many times.
