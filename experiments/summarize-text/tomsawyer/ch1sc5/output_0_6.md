Evaluation - 
Mark Twain shows a true mastery of the art of storytelling in this story. He creates a scene that is as funny as it is dramatic. He begins the story with the classic "call to action," in which the characters do not move forward until the story does. The humor in the story is created by the contrast between the character of Tom Sawyer and the character of the new boy. Tom is depicted as a typical boy, full of imagination and dreams of glory, and the new boy is depicted as a bully, with no imagination and a taste for violence. The humor in the story is heightened by the long speeches the boys make, and the

**Summary:**
**The Challenge - **

The two boys are in a standoff, each daring the other to attack. They
stand there, shoulder to shoulder, each with a foot placed at an angle
as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at
each other with hate. But neither can get an advantage.

The Conclusion - 

After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his
strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:

“You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and
he can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it,
too.”

“What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's
bigger than he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that
fence, too.”

“That's a lie.”

“_Your_ saying so don't make it so.”

Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:

“I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't
stand up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.”

The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:

“Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.”

“Don't you crowd me now; you better look out.”

“Well, you _said_ you'd do it--why don't you do it?”

“By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.”

**Summary:**
**The Challenge - **

A new boy, who is bigger than Tom, appears. He threatens Tom, who refuses to back down. The new boy proposes a fight. Tom is ready, but the new boy refuses to fight, saying that he is too small. Tom's insults make the new boy angrier, and the new boy eventually challenges Tom to a fight. Tom accepts the challenge, but the new boy won't back down. The two boys finally decide to fight.

The Fight - 

Tom and the new boy go to a nearby creek to fight. They start by insulting each other, and then move to pushing each other. The pushing turns into a shoving match, and the shoving match turns into a pushing match. They then begin to wrestle, and Tom finds that he can't get an advantage. After a few minutes, they stop wrestling and stand facing each other. Tom then taunts the new boy, and the new boy taunts Tom. They then start pushing each other again, and they continue to push each other until they are both hot and flushed.

The Fight is Broken Up - 

Tom is the first to give up, and he leaves. The new boy then leaves, too.

Commentary - 

The fight is described in the text, but it is not illustrated. The fight is broken up before it begins.

Text:
Tom turned around after a while, and started off. He went tearing along,
running as fast as he could go.

He ran toward his home with all his might, and arrived, out of breath.

“Why, Tom, where have you been?”

“I've been down to the creek, playing.”

“Why were you so long?”

“I stopped behind a bush, to rest.”

“Tom, you look as if you'd been fighting.”

“Why, I've just been wrestling with Bill Harper.”

“Tom, you _know_ your face is all black and blue.”

“That's where Bill Harper pinned me.”

“Pinned you?”

“Yes, he pinned me.”

“Why, Tom, you didn't let him do that.”

“Why, yes, I did.”

**Summary:**
**The Challenge - **
The boys start out as strangers, and immediately begin sizing each other up. 
Tom is smaller, but he has a fierce look in his eyes, and he's not afraid to 
take a dare. The new boy is taller, and has a superior air. Both boys are 
looking for ways to prove themselves.

The Challenge Accepted - 
The new boy, whose name is Sid, accepts Tom's dare that he can't step over 
the line Tom has drawn in the dirt. Sid shows off by doing it, but Tom, 
who is not impressed by things like that, says that he will fight Sid 
anyhow. Sid accepts the challenge, and the two boys square off.

The Start of the Fight - 
Sid and Tom are both trying to appear brave and confident, but underneath 
they're both afraid. Neither boy wants to be the first to strike a blow, but 
both are afraid of looking like a coward. Sid, who is feeling more confident 
now that he's won the dare, tries to goad Tom into starting the fight, but 
Tom won't fall for this. The boys are getting more and more frustrated. 

The Fight Gets Serious - 
The boys are still standing in front of each other, shoulder to shoulder. 
Tom tries to get Sid to back down by making fun of his hat, but Sid 
doesn't even notice. He's too busy trying to get Tom to start the fight. 
Finally, Tom grudgingly accepts another dare, and the two boys square off 
again.

The Fight Gets Ugly - 
Tom and Sid are now standing face to face, with each boy's hands on the 
other's collar. Sid taunts Tom, but Tom just laughs and says it's easy to 
talk big when you're not the one who's going to get hurt. Sid gets mad 
and gives Tom a shove, but Tom refuses to be intimidated. Sid tries to 
push Tom again, and this time Tom pushes back. The two boys start 
shoving and struggling, and then they start hitting each other. The fight 
gets more and more violent, and the boys end up rolling on the ground, 
throwing punches and trying to get the upper hand.

The Fight Ends - 
After a long, hard fight, the boys are both tired and sweaty.
