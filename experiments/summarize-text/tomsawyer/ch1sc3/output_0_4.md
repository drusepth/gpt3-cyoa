Text:

"Aunt Polly had a good idea of the truth, now, as to that swim. So she
said:

"Tom, it's a mean shame! You might a-swum, and had a good time, and
come out and told us, and we'd never been the wiser. But you wanted to
sneak and go in hiding. Now you just take off them wet things and
change to dry ones, and be quick about it. I'll warm up your supper,
and when you're finished I'll have a nice sup of hot coffee for you,
and I'll keep it hot, and have it all ready, and you can drink it when
you come in, and it'll make you all comfortable and warm, and then
you'll feel as good as new again, and I won't say a word, not a word, if
you do go off and leave us again. But mind you, if you feel that you
want to swim any more, you don't do it. That's flat. If I find out
you do, I won't let you come a-nigh the house for a week!”

The Model Boy said:

“It's a lie! I didn't go swimming!”

“I don't care what you did, or what you didn't do,” said the aunt;
“you just march right along and change them wet things, and never mind
your supper!”

The Model Boy said:

“I won't!”

The aunt said:

“You just will, or else I'll--”

She stopped, because she couldn't think of anything severe enough to
threaten him with. But she was in a fine rage, and she bounced out
and slammed the door after her. The Model Boy heard her steps
crashing around in the kitchen for a while, and then he heard her go
out of the house. He got up and locked the door and put the key in
his pocket.

**While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity**
**offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and**
**very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like**
**many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she**
**was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she**
**loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low**
**cunning. Said she:**

**“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?”**

**“Yes'm.”**

**“Powerful warm, warn't it?”**

**“Yes'm.”**

**“Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”**

**A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He**
**searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:**

**“No'm--well, not very much.”**

**The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:**

**“But you ain't too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect**
**that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing**
**that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew**
**where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:**

**“Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?”**

**Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of**
**circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new**
**inspiration:**

**“Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to**
**pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”**

**The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt**
**collar was securely sewed.**

**“Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey**
**and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a**
**singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. _This_ time.”**

**She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom**
**had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.**

**But Sidney said:**

**“Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,**
**but it's black.”**

**“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”**

**But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:**

**“Siddy, I'll lick you for that.”**

**In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into**
**the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle**
**carried white thread and the other black. He said:**

**“She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes**
**she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to**
**gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But**
**I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!”**

**He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well**
**though--and loathed him.**
