Text:

The schoolhouse was a small, cheap, pine building, set on brick
foundations--it was one of a thousand similar schoolhouses
throughout the land, and perchance it was not so pleasant a place
to live in as some other schoolhouses. It was a place to learn
in, however, and the only one the boy had known, and he loved it. He

was not a Model Boy, but he was near it. He could not remember that he
had ever been severely punished in school. He had brought home
very good report cards, and the teachers rather petted him. He
the schoolhouse was a place for him to be in, and he was always happy
there.

He loved the schoolhouse, but he loved the schoolhouse fairy still more,
for she was a veritable fairy in his eyes--none other than the
schoolteacher, whom he worshiped. He had seen her only a few times,
but those few times were enough--he could not forget her. He
had never dared speak to her, but he knew all about her. He knew
that her name was Miss Mary Ann Wilson; that she was twenty-three
years old; that her hair was brown and her eyes were blue; that she
was tall and straight, and always dressed in the latest fashion; that
she lived on a farm near school, and had a brother, Jack; that her
father was a well-to-do farmer; that she was a good teacher, and
was liked by the whole school; that she smiled often, and had a
pleasant voice; that the pupils liked to do anything she asked them
to do; that they did not dare to talk or laugh while she was
near; that she had never been known to lose her temper.

He knew all about her, but he did not know that she had never seen him,
and never dreamed that he existed. He had never seen her outside of
school, and did not know that she was good to poor people, and
often went to see them, and that her father and brother were
willing that she should do such things.

He did not know that she was often lonely and unhappy, and that she
sometimes cried, and that her greatest ambition was to go to
Philadelphia and take a course in a business college. He did not
know that she had a secret sorrow,

**Summary:**
**Polly and Sid at dinner catch Tom's hooky swim - **
He says he didn't want to go, but was not warm enough to go swimming.

He was not warm enough, but he is also damp. Polly, seeing that he is damp, accuses him of swimming.

He denies it, but Polly says he is a "singed cat" (one that got close to the fire, but did not get burnt) because he is damp.

Text:

After school Tom dodged around with the other boys, looking for a
good chance to “lay for” Sid, and satisfy his vengeance. At last he
found him playing marbles in a remote corner, and while the other
boys clustered around the game he took his chance. He fell upon Sid
with a ferocity that delighted his heart, and pounded him with his
grasping hands. Sid was heavy and stout for his age, but Tom was
mad and well-armed, so he had the best of it at first. Sid was

soon bleeding, and screaming for mercy. The boys took Tom's part,
and Sid was routed. When he came back to his corner, Tom
flourished the bloody and warlike marbles over his head, and
exultingly proclaimed his victory.

“You never giv him a fair show, Tom,” said Joe Harper. “If you'd a
left him a-holt of his shooter, he'd a laid you out.”

“Who'd you want to have a shot, Tom?” said another boy.

“I don't want to shoot anybody,” Tom said. “I don't want to,
but I just want him to let me alone.”

“P'raps he'll let you alone,” rejoined the other boy.

“I don't want anybody to let me alone,” said Tom. “I want to
fight 'em all, and I want to whip 'em all, too.”

“Well, I bet you Tom'll lick 'em all,” said Joe Harper.

“I bet he won't neither,” said another boy.

“Bet you anything he will,” said Joe.

“Tom,” said the boy, “you'll have to take off your jacket, you know,

Text:

Tom had been swimming and now came in to dinner. He was full of his
achievement and wanted to tell about it, but Aunt Polly fenced him off
with questions and comments:

“Tom, it was middling warm in that school, warn't it?”

“Yes'm.”

“Powerful warm, warn't it?”

“Yes'm.”

“Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”

“No'm--well, not very much.”

“But you ain't too warm now, though.”

Tom knew where the wind lay now, and so he had got up a lie ready. He said:

“Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?”

“I'd made sure you'd played hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye,
Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is--better'n

“Well, now, if I didn't think you'd sewed his collar with white thread,

“I did sew it with white! Tom!”

“Go 'long with ye!”

Tom was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the Model Boy very well

Aunt Polly's eyes twinkled, and she said:

“I'll say you did, Tom. And I'll make up a couple of sandwiches, and you
go to your reading.”

“I don't want no sandwiches.”

“Well, you can't go without anything.”

“Hold on,” said Tom, “I'll give you two bits.”

“Why, Tom, I wouldn't take a penny. Go along, now, and don't get your
clothes wet.”

Presently Tom slid out of the house and ran to the river bank. He
found Joe Harper and Ben Rogers, and the three set off together. They
clambered down the river bank, and stole silently along in the shade of
the trees that hung over the water. When they came to the ferry-landing,
they got aboard the boat and hid in the shadow of the trees. Presently

the boat emerged from the shade, and floated out into the moonshine. Tom

watched and saw the form of a man rise from the stern and cast off the
painter. The man stepped in and began to row away. Tom said:

“Sh!”

The boys waited until the man had gone a little way; and then Tom
sprang up, trembling with excitement, and threw the end of the painter
to Joe, and said:

“Here--quick! Pull her in!”

The boys tugged at the rope, and soon they had the boat and the
painter alongside. They got aboard, and Tom said:

“Hit her up--quick!”

The boys obeyed, and the boat leaped forward. Tom was in the stern,
and he had the painter in his hand. When they had gone a hundred
yards, Tom said:

“Hump yourselves, now, and give her a pull--she's slipping!”

They tugged, and the boat flew forward. Tom stood up, and

raised his free hand, and shouted:

“Hi! stop her!--quick!”

The man sprang to the oars and stopped the boat, and as he turned his
head and saw the boys, he said:

“Tom,” said Aunt Polly, “you get right down this minute and fetch me a
pan of water, and be quick about it, too.”

Tom knew the penalty of disobedience; so he started, in a very sour
mood, to the spring. He sulked along, muttering:

“It's just like women--always nagging, nagging, nagging, and
never giving a fellow a chance.”

“Stuff!” said a voice.

Tom startled and looked around, to see who spoke. He saw no one. The
voice seemed to come from the water.

“Hello! Where are you?” he called.

“In the water.”

Tom looked into the spring.

“Come out o' that!” he shouted. “I won't have this fooling.”

“It's no fooling; it's the truth.”

“There ain't anybody in there,” said Tom.

“Yes, there is too. Look!”

Tom looked, and saw a funny little man, with a big head and goggle
eyes, sitting on the bottom of the spring.

“Oh, blazes! Come out o' that!”

“All right, if you want me to.”

The little man rose slowly and awkwardly, like a cork coming to the top
of a bottle. He was very wet, and the water ran off from him as he
stood.

“I was just refreshing myself,” said the little man. “I find it very

cool and comfortable here.”

“Well, I don't want you to stay refreshing yourself here. I want you to

come out.”

The little man looked at Tom curiously, and said:

“What is your name?”

“Tom.”

“And a very good name, too. My name is Nobody.”

“I don't care what your name is. Come out, or I'll--”

“I don't mind if I do,” interrupted the little man. “In fact

**where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:**

**“Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?”**

**Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of**
**circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new**
**inspiration:**

**“Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to**
**pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”**

**The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt**
**collar was securely sewed.**

**“Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey**
**and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a**
**singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. _This_ time.”**

**She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom**
**had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.**

**But Sidney said:**

**“Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,**
**but it's black.”**

**“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”**

**But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:**

**“Siddy, I'll lick you for that.”**

**In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into**
**the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle**
**carried white thread and the other black. He said:**

**“She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes**
**she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to**
**gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But**
**I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!”**

**He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well**
**though--and loathed him.**

Analysis:

Tom sees a chance to impress his aunt with his superior intellect, but Sid's

Text:

The village library was a great convenience to the people of the
neighborhood--and a great inconvenience to the librarian, for
the latter was the only person in the village who had to work.

He was a brisk, capable little woman, and the library was an
object of pride to her. It was kept in what had once been the parlor of
the village inn, and it was well filled with a miscellaneous
collection of books. The librarian had a knack at making
borrowers feel at home--and at persuading them to take a book
home with them, instead of a magazine.

She was often troubled with failures in this respect; young men
and girls in the village could be relied upon to come for
a “periodical,” but when it came to a book, they shook their heads.

“No--I don't think I'll borrow a book to-day--it would be so
troublesome to read in the daytime on the train. I'll just
take a magazine.”

“But you can take the book home and read it at night.

“Oh, can I?”

“Certainly.”

“Well, I don't know--”

“You can take it home and read it.”

“I don't believe I'd better.”

“But you can read it at night.”

“Well--I don't know--”

“You can take it home and read it.”

“I don't believe I will.”

“But you can read it at night.”

“Well--all right. I'll take it.”

The librarian was a person of determination.

She was always saying to herself that she would not allow herself to
feel discouraged--and always feeling discouraged. She had hoped that
Tom Sawyer would come for a book--but he did not.

She told herself that she did not care--that it was none of her

business--and she would not allow herself
