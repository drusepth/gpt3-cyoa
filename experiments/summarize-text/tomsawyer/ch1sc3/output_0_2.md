**Polly and Sid at dinner catch Tom's hooky swim - **

Text:

Aunt Polly had a good heart, and she spoiled Tom whenever she had a
chance. Sid was of a meeker and more yielding disposition; he was
fond of Tom in his way, and sometimes amused himself with him; but
Tom's ways were not Sid's ways, and so he did not care much for his
society. Both the boys were subject to occasional fits of remorse and
reformation, and at such times they were company for each other.

Now Tom was troubled with a desire to be good. He discovered that
it was a troublesome desire, and he wondered if some good thing
would not come to him without the trouble of being good. He

thought the matter over, and finally said:

“I know what I'll do, Sid. I'll run away from home.”

Sid was much impressed by this tremendous resolution. He looked at
Tom a little distance, then he said:

“It's a gaudy good idea. Where will you run to?”

“Well, I don't know.”

“Anybody would know better'n to run away from home, if they didn't
know where to go to.”

“Why, Sid, I don't want to go anywhere in particular.”

“Well, wherever you go, you're going to leave somebody that's
sick, or poor, or in trouble, and it'll be worse for you,
tomorrow, than it is now.”

“Why, Sid, I don't want to leave anybody in trouble.”

“Well, you're going to, whether you want to or not.”

“Why, Sid, all folks ain't so.”

“Oh, yes, they are.”

“Why, Sid, the minister isn't.”

“Well, he ought to be.”

“Why, Sid, if I was to run away, I'd go to him.”

“Well, he wouldn't take you in, Tom. You know he wouldn't.”

“He would, too.”

“Why, Tom, he'd call the police and have you arrested.”

**Summary:**
**Polly and Sid at dinner catch Tom's hooky swim - **

Polly and Sid at dinner catch Tom's hooky swim. Polly asks Tom if he wanted to go swimming. Tom says no, but Polly knows he is lying. She asks Tom to unbutton his shirt collar, and he does. Polly sees that Tom's collar is sewed with white thread, and she knows he has been swimming. Tom says he will beat Sid for telling on him.

Analysis:

This passage is a good example of how Twain uses humor to make a point. The humor is in the way that Polly tries to trick Tom into telling her that he has been swimming. She does not want to know that he has been swimming, but she wants to trick him into telling her that he has been swimming. The humor is also in the way that Tom is able to outsmart Polly. He knows that she is trying to trick him, and he is able to avoid the trap she has set for him.

Text:

Tom went up-stairs to his miserable room and his miserable bed. The

tears were very near the surface; but he fought them down. He would be

strong, and hold his own against all the world. He would know how to

live, now. He would show them! He would show them all!

He undressed with feverish haste, and fell upon the bed, where, for a
time, he thought and thought, till his head swam with the effort and
the heat. And so he fell asleep.

He awoke in the night. The room was full of moonlight. His clock
stuck out from the wall, white and ghastly, pointing to twelve. He

listened. There was not a sound. He remembered that the clock had
stopped at ten, and the recollection seemed to add to the silence and
the loneliness. He almost wished he had not waked up; it was worse to
be awake than asleep.

He was thirsty, and he got up to drink. The pitcher was empty. He
remembered that he had finished the water it contained the night before.

He wondered if anybody was up, and still thirsty, in the big house. He
dared not go and ask for some. He could not bear the shame of it.

He crept to the window and looked out. The world was so still, so
white, so deathlike, under the moon, that it seemed
