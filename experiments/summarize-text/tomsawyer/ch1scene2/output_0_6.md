**Aunt Polly Decides Upon her Duty -**
Aunt Polly stands surprised a moment, and then breaks into a gentle laugh.
The phrase “broken into” is an example of an image that is visual and memorable, and therefore easier to recall later.

Tom's aunt Polly decides to “lay it on thick” when punishing Tom, because she feels she isn't doing her duty by him. She
lays on the switch “forty times”, but Tom “knows how to put her off” by pretending to be in pain. She doesn't lash him hard enough to 
break the skin, and Tom is still able to work the next day.
