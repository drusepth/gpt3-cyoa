**CHAPTER I. Y-o-u-u Tom -- Aunt Polly Decides Upon her Duty -- Tom Practices Music -- The Challenge -- A Private Entrance**
** Section 1. Y-o-u-u Tom**

**Summary:**
**Y-o-u-u Tom - An old lady with barely-working spectacles calls angrily for a boy named Tom, searches through the house for him, **
**steps outside into the tomato vines and “jimpson” weed garden, calls louder, hears him behind her in a pantry closet sneaking **
**jam, and barely grabs him by his collar as he attempts to run away. She attempts to switch him, but he distracts her with a **
**call of danger and escapes over a high board-fence.**

**“TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**“TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**“What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the**
**room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or**
**never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were**
**her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not**
**service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.**
**She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but**
**still loud enough for the furniture to hear:**

**“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--”**

**She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching**
**under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the**
**punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.**

**“I never did see the beat of that boy!”**

**She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the**
**tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So**
**she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:**

**“Y-o-u-u TOM!”**

**There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize**
**a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.**

**“There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in**
**there?”**

**“Nothing.”**

**“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that**
**truck?”**

**“I don't know, aunt.”**

**“Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you**
**didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.”**

**The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--**

**“My! Look behind you, aunt!”**

**The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.**
**The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and**
**disappeared over it.**

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**

Aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh. This laugh was a new thing in the family, and so was
distinctly alarming.

“Hoo! hoo! hoo!” she laughed. “So you was the one that was in
the closet! I wondered who it could be!”

Tom did not answer.

“I don't know when I've been so beat!” she said. “But I'll
learn you to go eavesdropping around, Tom Sawyer. You just wait
till I get you home!”

Still Tom did not answer.

“Why, Tom,” said Aunt Polly, in her surprise, “what _is_ the matter
with you?”

Tom's lip began to quiver, and the water come into his eyes.

“I'm--I'm--” he stammered, “I'm afraid I'll--I'll--”

“You'll what?”

“I'll _have_ to go to the bad place!” broke out Tom, and turned

to run, for he saw a change in Aunt Polly's face.

“Tom! Tom!” said she, in alarm. “What's the matter with you?”

“I'm afraid of the bad place, Aunt Polly!”

“Gracious, Tom, what _is_ the bad place?”

“Where they send bad boys,” said Tom, trembling.

“Don't you know?”

“No,” said Tom, “I don't.”

“Why, it's the--it's the--”

Aunt Polly stopped, and Tom waited anxiously.

“It's the--that place they send bad boys to,” she said, at last.

“Aunt Polly,” said Tom, “I've heard about the bad place all my 
life, but I never knew what it was till this minute. Is it a nice
place?”

“No, it ain't.”

“Is it a _bad_ place?”

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**

Aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh.

“Well, I never!” said she. “I must say, to see how you _do_
take on! I never see such a child!”

This was almost the first time she had ever called him “child.”

“There, there,” she said, “I didn't mean to _do_ anything to you,
Tom. You _know_ I didn't.”

Tom felt better.

“It was only because you said you _would_ do it,” he explained.

“Well, I never will again, Tom. I'm going to make a gentleman of you,
after all.”

“Oh, auntie, _do_!”

“I will, indeed,” said she, and she kissed him. “And you must go to
school, too.”

“Oh, _won't_ I be glad!”

“Yes, I'm going to see to it. And you must mind your teacher, and
mind _me_, and you'll get along.”

“And ain't I ever going to play any more, auntie?”

“Play! Well, maybe you _are_ a little old for play. You're going to
work.”

“Not _work!_”

“Yes--work.”

Tom's lip quivered.

“Don't cry, honey. You _shall_ play, too. You shall play just as
much as you want to.”

“Oh, _wonderful!_”

“But you must be good.”

“I'll be _good_, good as pie! Oh, _won't_ it be _nice!_”

“You won't have to do any hard work, and you won't have to go to
school if you don't want to.”

“I don't want to. I won't have to?”

“No, you'll be a good boy.”

“I will, I

**never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were**
**her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not**
**service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.**
**She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but**
**still loud enough for the furniture to hear:**

**“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--”**

**She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching**
**under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the**
**punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.**

**“I never did see the beat of that boy!”**

**She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the**
**tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So**
**she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:**

**“Y-o-u-u TOM!”**

**There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize**
**a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.**

**“There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in**
**there?”**

**“Nothing.”**

**“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that**
**truck?”**

**“I don't know, aunt.”**

**“Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you**
**didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.”**

**The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--**

**“My! Look behind you, aunt!”**

**The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.**
**The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and**
**disappeared over it.**

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**

Aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh. This laugh was a new thing in the family, and quite
contrary to family traditions. It was not the pleasant sort that
serves to ease off a little pleasantry, but a grave, honest laugh
that seemed to come right up from the depths of her nature.

“I'll do it,” said she. “I'll _have_ to do it.”

She had never done anything of this kind before, and it seemed strange
to her. But she said she would do it, and she would keep her word, too.

She took her spectacles off and laid them on the table, and then took
a seat and leaned her face upon her hand. The laugh had done her good
--she felt better. And now she began to wonder what Tom had been
doing to get into trouble. She could not make it out, for he was
generally such a good boy. She was just thinking that she would
have to give him a talking to, when she heard a footstep at the door.

The door opened, and Tom stepped in, very well dressed, and looking

like a different boy. He had on his Sunday clothes--they were

_good_ clothes--and he had his Sunday face on. It was not a bad face,

by any means; but it had a crafty look. His aunt began to wonder

more than ever what had happened.

“Tom, where _have_ you been?”

“Over to town, aunt.”

“What were you doing there?”

“Looking around.”

“Did you meet anybody you knew?”

“Yes, I met Huck Finn.”

“Oh, you did, did you?”

Tom saw that his aunt was getting ready for a lecture, and so he

interposed:

“Auntie, I met him on business. I'm going to play a trick on him.”

“Tom, you--”

“Oh, auntie, _please_ don't! I know all about it, and I can't help it.

I'm in for it, and I'd do it again
