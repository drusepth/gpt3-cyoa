**CHAPTER I. Y-o-u-u Tom -- Aunt Polly Decides Upon her Duty -- Tom Practices Music -- The Challenge -- A Private Entrance**
** Section 1. Y-o-u-u Tom**

**Summary:**
**Y-o-u-u Tom - An old lady with barely-working spectacles calls angrily for a boy named Tom, searches through the house for him, **
**steps outside into the tomato vines and “jimpson” weed garden, calls louder, hears him behind her in a pantry closet sneaking **
**jam, and barely grabs him by his collar as he attempts to run away. She attempts to switch him, but he distracts her with a **
**call of danger and escapes over a high board-fence.**

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**
**“TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**“TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**“What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the**
**room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or**
**never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were**
**her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not**
**service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.**
**She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but**
**still loud enough for the furniture to hear:**

**“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--”**

**She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching**
**under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the**
**punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.**

**“I never did see the beat of that boy!”**

**She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the**
**tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So**
**she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:**

**“Y-o-u-u TOM!”**

**There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize**
**a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.**

**“There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in**
**there?”**

**“Nothing.”**

**“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that**
**truck?”**

**“I don't know, aunt.”**

**“Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you**
**didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.”**

**The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--**

**“My! Look behind you, aunt!”**

**The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.**
**The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and**
**disappeared over it.**

**Summary:**
**Aunt Polly Decides Upon her Duty - Aunt Polly stands surprised a moment, and then breaks into a gentle laugh.

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**

Aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle laugh.

“Well, I never!” said she. “I reckon the boy was just hungry, that's all, and
there ain't nothing wrong in that. I'm glad I didn't whack him, anyway.

But it's all the more reason I ought to make him work, for it 'll do him good
and keep him out of mischief. But lawsy, he's so good and sweet, it's just
as hard to whack him as 't would be a dog. I ain't got the heart for it.

I ain't _got_ the heart for it, and I ain't _going_ to do it, nuther.

I know what _I'll_ do--I'll _pretend_ to whack him. Yes, I'll _pretend_ to
whack him, and _that_'ll save me, and _he'll_ think I _did_ whack him, and
that'll save _him_--won't it? Yes, that's a real good idea. I'll do that.”

So she laid down the switch, and saying, “There, now, _that's_ a good boy,” she
took Tom in her lap and began to pet him, which was her way of pretending to
whack him. And she really did whack him, too, but only on the arms, and
on the shoulders, and on the legs up to the knees, and on the hips, and on
the back and the stomach, and on the neck, and on the face and the
forehead, and on the nose, and on the eyes, and on the ears, and part of
the time she tickled him, and he was in such a state of mind that he
was fit for any sort of mischief that ever was. He certainly was.

She was very careful, however, not to whack him where anybody could see
the marks, for the town would be sure to go on the picnic if they knew she had
whipped him, and she was determined that they shouldn't know it. So she
whipped him on the back part of his neck, and on the sides of his neck,
and under the ear, and on the back part of his shoulders, and on his
