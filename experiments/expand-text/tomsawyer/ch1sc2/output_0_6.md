** Section 1. Y-o-u-u Tom**

**Summary:**
**Y-o-u-u Tom - An old lady with barely-working spectacles calls angrily for a boy named Tom, searches through the house for him, **
**steps outside into the tomato vines and “jimpson” weed garden, calls louder, hears him behind her in a pantry closet sneaking **
**jam, and barely grabs him by his collar as he attempts to run away. She attempts to switch him, but he distracts her with a **
**call of danger and escapes over a high board-fence.**

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**
**“TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**“TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**“What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!”**

**No answer.**

**The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the**
**room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or**
**never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were**
**her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not**
**service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.**
**She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but**
**still loud enough for the furniture to hear:**

**“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--”**

**She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching**
**under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the**
**punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.**

**“I never did see the beat of that boy!”**

**She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the**
**tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So**
**she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:**

**“Y-o-u-u TOM!”**

**There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize**
**a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.**

**“There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in**
**there?”**

**“Nothing.”**

**“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that**
**truck?”**

**“I don't know, aunt.”**

**“Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you**
**didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.”**

**The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--**

**“My! Look behind you, aunt!”**

**The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.**
**The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and**
**disappeared over it.**

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**

Aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh. She decided that she must do her duty by her nephew, and
that she would make him work the next day to punish him for playing
hookey. She knew that he hated work more than anything else, and
that she must do her duty by him.

She went to the closet, selected a stout hickory rod, and
took it to bed with her. She did not sleep much. She couldn't,
although she wanted to. If she dozed off for a moment, she dreamed
of being chased by snakes or of falling over precipices, and she
woke up with a clammy sweat.

She got up at half past four in the morning, and lit the lamp.

She did not feel very rested, and she was truly sorry that she had
invented that excuse to get up out of bed; but there was no use
going to bed again; she would get up and make the fire, and go
down cellar and get some apples to pare for the pies. She might
as well be doing something as lying there--or thinking.

She dressed herself quietly, so as not to disturb her husband, and
went down cellar. She toiled awhile, and then decided that it was
too dark to work. She would finish that tomorrow. She came up
the steps, with a heavy heart, and sat down on a chair by the
table. She wanted to go to bed and cuddle down under the
covers, and forget there.

But that would not do. She had a duty to do, and she must do it.

She would not allow her husband to be disturbed any more. She
would get up early in the morning, and get that work done. She
would make that boy get up and help her.

She went to bed and slept soundly.

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**
She stood there a moment, then she said: “I might have expected it;
I ought to've known better; you can't hire _that_ child to work,
it's a shame to even _ask_ him. You just wait till I catch you
home, you--”

She was going on, but she stopped suddenly. Tom was such a
favorite, and it _would_ be such a shame,--and _he_ so willing
and anxious to work, too, if--she only needed to _think_--and then
she struck a brilliant idea, and her face lighted joyfully.

“I've got it, I've got it!” she exclaimed. “I've got a job for you,
Tom. It's nice and easy and you can have a good time doing it.”

“What is it, aunt?”

“Well, you see, it's like this.”

She hesitated, and Tom said: “I'm listening.”

“You can take care of the baby for a day or two.”

“Why, I'll be glad to.”

“That's always the way. You would be willing to work, if it was

something you were interested in.”

“Why, it's just play, aunt.”

“Very well, then; that's all I want.”

“What'll I do?--teach it to walk?”

“No, indeed! It can do that,--and talk, too.”

“Is it a baby, aunt?”

“Yes, it's a baby.”

“Well, I don't mind taking care of it, but I'd ruther have a dog.

How old is it?”

“Two years and a half.”

“It don't talk.”

“It will in a month or two.”

“Why, it can't walk?”

“It can stand and take a few steps.”

“Is it healthy?”

“It's as healthy as it can be.”

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**

Aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then said:

“I put a little jam on a plate for you a while ago, and here you've been

and eaten it all up! You are the very hardest-hearted boy I ever saw,

Tom. It's wrong to waste the good gifts of Providence, that's what it is.

You go and think about that, and maybe you'll be a little more grateful

next time.”

Tom thought he might as well be grateful now as next time, if he _could_

only get some of the jam to eat meantime.

“Aunt,” said he, “do you think you could give me a _little_ jam

anyway--not much--”

“No, I can't, Tom; I'm told the mince-meat's all gone. You can have

some in a couple of days, though, if you'll stop eating all that

jam.”

“Much!”

“Yes, much. You eat more jam than any boy I ever saw.”

“Other boys don't like it, aunt.”

“Well, other boys haven't got _your_ appetite, Tom.”

“Has any one been talking with you about me, aunt?”

“No; why?”

“Well, you just spoke as if you _had_ been.”

“I don't remember.”

“Well, aunt, I was thinking--if you _would_ give me that jam--”

“Oh, I can't, Tom.”

“Well, aunt, I was thinking that--”

“Well, what were you thinking, Tom?”

“I was thinking I could take _it_--if you _wouldn't_ see.”

Aunt Polly smiled.

“Is that all?” said she.

“All.”

“Then I'll give you the jam.”

“All!”

“Hush, Tom!”

She went to the closet, and got the jar of jam,

**“I never did see the beat of that boy!”**

**She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the**
**tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So**
**she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:**

**“Y-o-u-u TOM!”**

**There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize**

**The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--**

**“My! Look behind you, aunt!”**

**The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.**

“A-ha! So you've been _there_, have you?”

The old lady took her spectacles down and laid them on the Bible, and
wiped her eyes with a blue cotton handkerchief dotted with white
stars.

“I've always said it,” she said, “and I always shall say it--that
boy is the veryest rascal!”

Then she wiped her eyes again, and went on talking to herself.

“Always up to some devilment or other. He's the hardest child to
drive a pin's head into that I ever saw. And it's the same way with his
father--and mother, too, before she died. But laws bless me, I'm
getting forgetful, ain't I? I don't wonder, such weather as it's been

“And to think of his pretending to be asleep at the same time!

I never did see such a boy!”

She felt a little conscience-stricken when she thought of this
pretense, and so she prayed a little over it, thus:

“Now I lay me down to sleep, I--I--I--I--”

She stopped, for she couldn't remember the rest of the verse.

“I can't remember any more of it,” she said. “But I lay me down to
sleep, and I--I--I--what was it I _was_ going to do when I lay
down?”

She couldn't remember.

“I'm a laying myself down to sleep, and I--I--I--Oh, I know! I'm
going to _pray_ that the Lord will forgive Tom, and not send
an evil spirit to fetch him away, as he's been accustomed to
doing for _wicked_ children. But laws! he's been so worried,
maybe the Lord'll excuse him this time, and not take him away.

He's got a mighty good heart, Tom has, and I ain't a-going to give
up hoping he'll run straight yet.”

She went on talking to herself about Tom, and every now and then
she'd take up the glass and look in it and drop it again.

“He's got the worst

Aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh.

“Well, I never!” said she. “I must say, to think of that I Tom!”

She stopped, and then added: “But I don't know as I ought to laugh at it. 

He _is_ a good boy, _sometimes_--just _sometimes_. It's the bad 
watches that makes him all the time. But he's just got to be humored, 
because he _is_ the head of the family, and nobody but just 
him and his uncle would ever think of stirring up any _dis_turbance, 
and I don't feel no ways able to manage him, not _no_ ways. He's got 
all them boys, and they're just _all_ alike, just _all_ alike-every 
one of them's got his own way, and not one of them's ever going to give up 
_his_ way for any _one_ else in this world.”

She stopped again, and then said: “But come to think, he's _got_ to be 
whipped, and I _know_ it. I can't get out of it. So, come along, we'll 
go and do it.”

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**
Aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle laugh. She
decided that this was a new and not uninteresting phase of Tom's
character, and she resolved to examine it further.

She took her seat in the arm-chair, and, having once more called
Tom, she said:

“Now, sir, what _is_ this I hear about you?”

“I don't know, aunt.”

“Don't know! You don't know?”

“No'm.”

“Humph! You _ought_ to know.”

“Well, 'm, I don't, though.”

“Don't you _know_ you didn't come when you were called?”

“No'm--_is_ that so?”

“Stop and think a moment.”

The lad reflected. He looked up at the ceiling, and his face 
expressed a deep inward struggle between honest desire to please 
his benefactress and a strong temptation to betray a trust.

“Tom,” said the old lady, “no, you _don't_ look guilty--you look 
as innocent as if you hadn't had anything to do with that 
disobedience; but I know better.”

“Well, _am_ I to blame, aunt?”

“Yes, Tom.”

“I didn't come when I was called.”

“But you might have come.”

“I _could_ have come, if I'd wanted to.”

“Yes--you could have come--and you _should_ have come when you
were called.”

“I _couldn't_ help it, aunt.”

“Couldn't help it? Why couldn't you help it?”

“Couldn't help it, aunt. I'd _just_ got--”

“Just got what?”

“Well, _started_ to play, you know.”

“So you could n't come!”

“I could _try_ to come

**END OF SUMMARY**

**Text:**

She took up her spectacles, and as she opened the closet door she saw a
hand thrust in between the hinges. She pulled the door toward her, and
a small boy tumbled into her arms.

It was Tom. She thrust him back, shut the door, and locked it.

“Tom! What a trick to play! You know your aunt Polly's heart is 
set on your being a good boy; and here you've gone and done--”

“I didn't do anything, aunt.”

“Tom, don't lie to me--I can't bear it. What _did_ you do?”

“I didn't do anything, I tell you.”

“Tom, I'll not believe you. Tell me _directly_ what you did, or it
shall be the worse for you.”

“I didn't do anything.”

“Look here, Tom, I know _you're_ up to some mischief or other. Now 
tell me, and have it over. What did you do?”

“I didn't do anything, aunt.”

“Oh, Tom, I'm afraid you're going to be a stubborn, aggravating child. 
You're going to be a shame and a disgrace.”

“I won't be, aunt. I won't ever be bad again. I only just wanted to
hurry and tell you--”

“You _shall_ tell me.”

“I'll tell you, auntie, but you mustn't go and whip me, and I did so
hurry.”

“I'll whip you, anyway.”

“Auntie, I'll tell you _directly_--directly. I just wanted to get ahead of
Bobby.”

“Bobby who?”

“Bobby Morgan--I just wanted to get ahead of him, that's all.”

“What did you want to get ahead of him for?”

“Why, they're going to have a race, and I just wanted to get ahead of
him.”

“Is that all you wanted to get ahead of
