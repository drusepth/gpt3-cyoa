Tom watches the new boy from his window, and as he plays, the boy stops and listens. The boy, whose real name is “Injun Joe”, 
sees Tom looking at him, and he slowly walks toward the house, trying to look as scary as possible. Tom goes to his door to confront the boy, but he hides behind the door and refuses to open it. 
The boy comes closer, and Tom opens the door and tells him to leave. The boy does not understand him, so Tom makes him understand by pushing him off the porch. The boy walks away, and Tom closes the door.
